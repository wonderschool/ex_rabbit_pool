# `ex_rabbit_pool`

A RabbitMQ connection pooling library written in Elixir

## Is this lib still maintained?

Yes!, but this is not yet another amqp framework, the whole purpose of this lib is to implement just the pooling side of rabbitmq connections which is now **feature complete**, we still need to finish some TODOs and improvements inside the lib but we are not planning to add any new features to it, but if you think there is something left in this regards please don't hesitate to create a ticket so we can discuss it.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_rabbit_pool` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_rabbit_pool, "~> 1.0.3"}
  ]
end
```

## General Overview

- `ex_rabbit_pool` creates a pool or many pools of connections to RabbitMQ, we don't care about isolating access to each
  worker that's why we use a pool purely in order to spread load (pool config strategy :fifo)

- each connection worker traps exits and links the connection process to it

- each connection worker creates a pool of channels and links them to it

- when a client checks out a channel out of the pool the connection worker monitors that client to return the channel into it in case of a crash

- in case you don't want to pool channels, you can disable this feature
  by setting the `channels` number to 0, then you can create channels on demand

## High Level Architecture

When starting a connection worker :

- We start a pool of multiplexed channels to RabbitMQ
- Store the channel pool to the connection workers state (we can move this later to ets).

Then:

- The connection worker traps exists of RabbitMQ channels - which means that :
  - If a channel crashes, the connection worker is going to be able to start another channel
  - If a connection to RabbitMQ crashes we are going to be able to restart that connection, remove all crashed channels and then restart them with a new connection;

Also:

- We are able to easily:
  - Monitor clients accessing channels,
  - Queue and dequeue channels from the pool in order to make them accessible to one client at a time reducing the potential for race conditions.

## Setup RabbitMQ with docker

```bash
# pull RabbitMQ image from docker
$> docker pull rabbitmq:3.7.7-management
# run docker in background
# name the container
# remove container if already exists
# attach default port between the container and your laptop
# attach default management port between the container and your laptop
# start rabbitmq with management console
$> docker run --detach --rm --hostname bugs-bunny --name roger_rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.7.7-management
# if you need to stop the container
$> docker stop roger_rabbit
# if you need to remove the container manually
$> docker container rm roger_rabbit
```

## Supervision hierarchy

## Setting Up Multiple Connection pools

It’s a good practice to not have consumers and producers on the same connection
(since if something goes to flow mode the connection will be blocked and
consumers won’t be able to help RabbitMQ to offload all the messages), that's
why we support setting up multiple queues thanks to poolboy

```elixir
rabbitmq_config = [
  channels: 1,
]

# Connection Pool Configuration
producers_conn_pool = [
  name: {:local, :producers_pool},
  worker_module: ExRabbitPool.Worker.RabbitConnection,
  size: 1,
  max_overflow: 0
]

consumers_conn_pool = [
  name: {:local, :consumers_pool},
  worker_module: ExRabbitPool.Worker.RabbitConnection,
  size: 1,
  max_overflow: 0
]

ExRabbitPool.PoolSupervisor.start_link(
  rabbitmq_config: rabbitmq_config,
  connection_pools: [producers_conn_pool, consumers_conn_pool]
)

producers_conn = ExRabbitPool.get_connection(:producers_pool)
consumers_conn = ExRabbitPool.get_connection(:consumers_pool)

ExRabbitPool.with_channel(:producers_pool, fn {:ok, channel} ->
  ...
end)

ExRabbitPool.with_channel(:consumers_pool, fn {:ok, channel} ->
  ...
end)
```

## Setting Up Queues on Start Up

We support setting up queues when starting up the supervision tree via
`ExRabbitPool.Worker.SetupQueue`, right now it doesn't handle reconnect logic
for you, so if you have a reconnection and you are working with `auto_delete: true`
queues, you need to handle this case by your self (re-create those queues because
if connectivity drops, `auto_delete: true` queues are going to be de deleted
automatically and if you try to use one of them you would have an error as the
queue no longer exist).

## Setting up a direct exchange with bindings

![Direct Exchange Multiple](https://www.rabbitmq.com/img/tutorials/direct-exchange.png)

```elixir
rabbitmq_config = [
  ..., # Basic Rabbit Connection Configuration
]

queues_config = [
  queues: [
    [
      queue_name: "Q1",
      exchange: "X",
      queue_options: [],
      exchange_options: [],
      bind_options: [routing_key: "orange"]
    ],
    [
      queue_name: "Q2",
      exchange: "X",
      queue_options: [],
      exchange_options: [],
      bind_options: [routing_key: "black"]
    ],
    [
      queue_name: "Q2",
      exchange: "X",
      queue_options: [],
      exchange_options: [],
      bind_options: [routing_key: "green"]
    ]
  ]
]

# Basic Connection Pool Configuration
rabbitmq_conn_pool = [...]

ExRabbitPool.PoolSupervisor.start_link(
  rabbitmq_config: rabbitmq_config,
  connection_pools: [rabbitmq_conn_pool]
)

ExRabbitPool.Worker.SetupQueue.start_link({pool_id, queues_config})
```

## Setting up a direct exchange with multiple bindings

![Direct Exchange Multiple](https://www.rabbitmq.com/img/tutorials/direct-exchange-multiple.png)

```elixir
rabbitmq_config = [
  ..., # Basic Rabbit Connection Configuration
]

queues_config = [
  queues: [
    [
      queue_name: "Q1",
      exchange: "X",
      queue_options: [],
      exchange_options: [],
      bind_options: [routing_key: "black"]
    ],
    [
      queue_name: "Q2",
      exchange: "X",
      queue_options: [],
      exchange_options: [],
      bind_options: [routing_key: "black"]
    ]
  ]
]

# Basic Connection Pool Configuration
rabbitmq_conn_pool = [...]

ExRabbitPool.PoolSupervisor.start_link(
  rabbitmq_config: rabbitmq_config,
  connection_pools: [rabbitmq_conn_pool]
)

ExRabbitPool.Worker.SetupQueue.start_link({pool_id, queues_config})
```

## EchoConsumer - Example

In the `examples` directory you are going to find an implementation of a RabbitMQ
consumer using the library, all you need to do is, starting RabbitMQ
[with docker](#setup-rabbitmq-with-docker), and copy/paste the following code into the `iex` console.
What it does is, setup the connection pool, setup the queues, exchanges and
bindings to use, start the consumer and finally publish some messages to the
exchange so the consumer can echo it.

```elixir
rabbitmq_config = [channels: 2]

rabbitmq_conn_pool = [
  name: {:local, :connection_pool},
  worker_module: ExRabbitPool.Worker.RabbitConnection,
  size: 1,
  max_overflow: 0
]

{:ok, pid} =
  ExRabbitPool.PoolSupervisor.start_link(
    rabbitmq_config: rabbitmq_config,
    connection_pools: [rabbitmq_conn_pool]
  )

queue = "ex_rabbit_pool"
exchange = "my_exchange"
routing_key = "example"

ExRabbitPool.with_channel(:connection_pool, fn {:ok, channel} ->
  {:ok, _} = AMQP.Queue.declare(channel, queue, auto_delete: true, exclusive: true)
  :ok = AMQP.Exchange.declare(channel, exchange, :direct, auto_delete: true, exclusive: true)
  :ok = AMQP.Queue.bind(channel, queue, exchange, routing_key: routing_key)
end)

{:ok, consumer_pid} = Example.EchoConsumer.start_link(pool_id: :connection_pool, queue: queue)

ExRabbitPool.with_channel(:connection_pool, fn {:ok, channel} ->
  :ok = AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, exchange, routing_key, "Hello World!")
  :ok = AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, exchange, routing_key, "Hell Yeah!")
end)
```
